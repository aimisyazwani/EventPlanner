INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT

In today's fast-paced world, event planning has become increasingly complex, demanding more efficient and effective solutions. Our project aims to address this need by developing a comprehensive event planner web application. This application is designed to streamline the process of organizing events, whether they are corporate conferences, weddings, parties, or community gatherings. By integrating a range of features such as scheduling, budgeting, vendor management, and guest list tracking, our platform seeks to simplify event planning and enhance user experience.
